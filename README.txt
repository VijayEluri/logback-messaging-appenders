Howdy!

So far this is really, nothing.

I've run this nothing locally against:

AMQP: Working.
- Tested on RabbitMQ v1.7.0

XMPP: Not working, at all, at the moment
- Tested on http://www.ejabberd.im/ version 2.1.2
- Tested on http://mina.apache.org/vysper/ version whatever-I-have-checked-out-and-installed-in-my-local-Maven-repos
